 @param block The block that is executed for each match of @c pattern in the receiver. The block returns a @c NSString and takes four arguments:

 @param &nbsp;&nbsp;capturedRanges A @c NSArray containing the ranges matched by each capture group present in @c pattern. If a capture group did not match anything, it will contain a @c NSRange equal to @c {NSNotFound, 0}.
 @param &nbsp;&nbsp;stop A reference to a Boolean value. Setting the value to @c YES within the block stops further enumeration of the array. If a block stops further enumeration, that block continues to run until itâs finished.
